    extraTwigNamespaces:
      type: object
      title: Extra Twig Namespaces
      description: >-
        You can add Twig Namespaces using this and it serves two purposes:

        1. To add extra namespaces that have not been declared
        2. To add extra paths to previously declared namespaces

        Assuming we've already declared the `foo` namespaces to look in `~/my-dir1`.
        Then someone uses `extraNamespaces` to declare that `foo` will look in `~/my-dir2`
        This will not overwrite it, but *prepend* to the paths, resulting in a namespace setting like this:

        ```
        'foo': {
         paths: ['~/my-dir2', '~/my-dir1']
        }
        ```

        This causes the folder declared in `extraNamespaces` to be looked in first for templates, before our default; allowing end user developers to selectively overwrite some templates.

        Follows the conventions from [this plugin](https://packagist.org/packages/evanlovely/plugin-twig-namespaces).
