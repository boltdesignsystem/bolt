###### Install via NPM

```
npm install @bolt/components-card
```

## Description

The preview card presents users as a way of taking action to discover more information. They commonly exist as links to more detailed long-form content, links off-site, and occasionally inline videos.

## Best Practices

* Placement should be in a manner where it is easily scannable
* The headline should call out what the benefit is of clicking through
* Avoid cluttering a card with too many calls to action
* If the headline can work as link affordance without a button, don't have a button
* If the headline does not clearly invoke action, use a CTA at the bottom of the card to entice the user
