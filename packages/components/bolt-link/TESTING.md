# Link component developer testing steps

## Link renders as expected

1. Server-side pre-rendered custom elements perform a one-time upgrade to become fully client-side rendered web components. When a web component initializes, its inner HTML is replaced, including the `<replace-with-children>` helper element, while the content inside the HTML is retained.

1. When a web component initializes, it will render either to the Shadow DOM or to the Light DOM. The default behavior is to render to the Shadow DOM, but it will render to the Light DOM in the following cases:

   - You are using an older browser (IE11).
   - The component is nested inside a `<form>` tag:

     ```html
     <form>
       <bolt-link>Light DOM inside a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag</bolt-link>
     </form>
     ```

   - The component has the `no-shadow` attribute:

     ```html
     <bolt-link no-shadow
       >Light DOM via the <code>no-shadow</code> attribute</bolt-link
     >
     ```

1. When a `<bolt-link>` is moved around the page by external JS, it should render as expected, i.e. it does not disappear.

## Responds to prop changes as expected

Updating `<bolt-link>` props in the browser should trigger the component to re-render, reflecting the new prop value. For example:

1. Change the `url` prop and the internal `<a>` element should update its `href` attribute to match.
1. Change the `target` prop and the internal `<a>` element should update its `target` attribute to match.
1. Change the `display` prop from `flex` to `inline` and the internal `<a>` element class should update from `c-bolt-link--display-flex` to `c-bolt-link--display-inline`.

## Slotted content renders as expected

Slotted content inside `<bolt-link>`, when the component initializes, should be placed inside the correct inner container. For example:

1. Link text should be placed in the default slot and wrapped in a `<span>` element with the class `c-bolt-link__text`.
1. An icon in the `after` or `before` slot should be wrapped in a `<span>` element with the class `c-bolt-link__icon`.

## Initial `<a>` tag handled as expected

When an `<a>` tag is placed directly inside the `<bolt-link>` element (prior to component initializing), the component will repurpose attributes from that `<a>` tag when it sets up its own internally-rendered `<a>` element. This is one way to pass additional attributes to the inner `<a>` tag:

```html
<bolt-link>
  <a href="https://google.com" data-foo="bar">Hello world!</a>
</bolt-link>
```

Note: an inner `<a>` tag without an `href` attribute does not automatically inherit the `url` prop from its parent. This will not work:

```html
<bolt-link url="https://google.com">
  <a data-foo="bar">Hello world!</a>
</bolt-link>
```

# Link component functional testing steps

Functional testing should be performed manually by the QA team across the standard compliment of browsers. In each scenario, browser-type is specified when necessary. If browser type is not specified, the test applies to both "desktop" and "mobile" browsers.

## Feature: Link

    In order to navigate to another location from a Pega web property
    As a UX designer, developer or content administrator
    I need to ensure the "bolt-link" component renders and functions as expected

## Scenario: Link hover state

1. Given I am using a "desktop" browser
1. And I am viewing the [Basic Link page](https://master.boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/patterns/40-components-link-05-link/40-components-link-05-link.html)
1. Then I should see a link with the text "This is a text link"
1. When I mouse over the link
1. Then the link text-color should lighten

## Scenario: Inline link wrapping

1. Given I am using a "desktop" browser
1. And I am viewing the [Link Display Variations page](https://master.boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/patterns/40-components-link-10-link-display-variations/40-components-link-10-link-display-variations.html)
1. And I am looking at the section "Inline link"
1. Then I should see a paragraph that contains two links
1. When I resize the browser to less than 600px wide
1. Then the link text should wrap to the next line

## Scenario: Flex link icon position

1. Given I am using a "desktop" browser
1. And I am viewing the [Link Display Variations page](https://master.boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/patterns/40-components-link-10-link-display-variations/40-components-link-10-link-display-variations.html)
1. And I am looking at the section "Flex link"
1. Then I should see two links
1. And each link has an icon to the left or right
1. When I resize the browser to less than 900px wide
1. Then the link text should wrap to the next line
1. And the icon should remain "fixed" beside the link

## Scenario: Link vertical-alignment variations (start)

1. Given I am viewing the [Link Valign Variations page](https://master.boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/patterns/40-components-link-20-link-valign-variations/40-components-link-20-link-valign-variations.html)
1. And I am looking at the section "Link Valign Variations"
1. And I am looking at the sub-section "Valign: start"
1. Then I should see a link with an icon "fixed" to the left
1. And the icon should be vertically-aligned with the top of the link text

## Scenario: Link vertical-alignment variations (center)

1. Given I am viewing the [Link Valign Variations page](https://master.boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/patterns/40-components-link-20-link-valign-variations/40-components-link-20-link-valign-variations.html)
1. And I am looking at the section "Link Valign Variations"
1. And I am looking at the sub-section "Valign: center"
1. Then I should see a link with an icon "fixed" to the left
1. And the icon should be vertically-aligned with the center of the link text

## Scenario: Link icon variations
