{#
/**
 * @file
 * A form button element.
 *
 * This is designed to work just like <bolt-button> except that:
 *    a) It accepts fewer parameters.  The underlying assumption is that you really
 *       shouldn't need many options for a form submit button.
 *    b) It is not rendered using javascript.  That ensures that Bolt javascript cannot
 *       interfere with anything the consuming end wants to do with its forms.
 *
 * Available variables
 *   - attributes (object): A list of HTML attributes for the button element.
 *   - text (renderable, REQUIRED): Text to show within the button
 *   - width (enum): One of "full", "full@small", or "" (empty string)
 *   - icon (object): data as expected by the bolt-icon component.
