A grid of colored vector shapes for use in backgrounds. Part of the Bolt “Components” CSS framework that powers the [Bolt Design System](https://www.boltdesignsystem.com).
This component will likely not be used on its own, but rather will be a dependency of another component that includes it.

###### Install via NPM
```
npm install @bolt/components-background-shapes
```

## Description

Background shapes bring the brand further into Bolt. These shapes create a background texture for bands. The shapes are offset at an angle offset inside a band component.

## Best Practices

* Set to the right side of the band if there is copy on the left.
* Set to the left side of the band if there is copy on the right.
* Shapes can be used behind cards or thumbnail images (video or just image) but should not make the content hard to consume by the user.
* Shapes should not be used behind any text elements. Doing so makes the text hard to read.
* Don't use background shapes if it makes the content in the band hard to parse
