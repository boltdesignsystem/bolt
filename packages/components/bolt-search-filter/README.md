A wrapper for search filters that primarily handles mobile behavior. Part of the Bolt “Components” CSS framework that powers the [Bolt Design System](https://www.boltdesignsystem.com).

NOTE: as of this writing, this component is used only for internal Bolt demos and not in any actual search.  It may require some modification to be usable in the real world.

###### Install via NPM

```
npm install @bolt/components-search-filter
```
