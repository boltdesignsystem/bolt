<h3>Inline link</h3>
<p>
  This is an {{ inline_link_icon_before }}, and this is an {{ inline_link_icon_after }}. Inline links are truly inline, which means the text can wrap to a second line and the icon falls on the baseline either before or after the text.
</p>

<h3>Flex link</h3>
<p>
  {{ flex_link_icon_before }}
</p>
<p>
  {{ flex_link_icon_after }}

<h3>Block link</h3>
<p>
  {{ block_link_icon_before }}
</p>
<p>
  {{ block_link_icon_after }}
