<bolt-text>
  A tooltip is used to provide descriptive help to the user about the control that the mouse is over. For instance, moving the mouse over {{ tooltip }} for a second can display a small popup label containing more detailed description. When the mouse is moved again, the tooltip disappears. This is a useful means of providing additional details about a user interface without cluttering up the main interface.
