            <p>321% ROI in less than 12 months. 75% cost savings. 75% productivity improvements. These are transformational outcomes. Getting there takes more than just a few robots. You need one unified automation engine.</p>

            <p>Use business process management to orchestrate people and systems. Deploy RPA to take repetitive work out of your operation. Use case management to manage it all from end to end.</p>

            <p>You define service level agreements, route work, and apply rules and advanced intelligence. You can jumpstart with RPA, sure – but you’ll be able to fly past the 20% improvement companies see from robotics alone.</p>

            <p>Why? Because Pega’s capabilities are unified on one platform. No duct tape. No wiring a bunch of things together. You think about outcomes from end to end. Your technology should be able to get that end to end work done.</p>
